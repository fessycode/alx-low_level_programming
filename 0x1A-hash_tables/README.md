__Project Name:__ ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING

__Project Scope:__ Project Task 0x1A C - Hash tables

__Project Details:__ Hash tables are by comparison one of the fastest
data structure among others, linked lists, array and more. Hash tables
uses a hash function to map data of key:value pair to a fixed index
in a collection of linked lists organized as tables.

This section explores a basic examples and basic features of a hash tables

# Hash Tables

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. It aims to learn how to implement Hash Tables with **C language**.

Hash tables are by comparison one of the fastest data structure among others, linked lists, array and more. Hash tables uses a hash function to map data of key:value pair to a fixed index in a collection of linked lists organized as tables.
